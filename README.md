An audio application/plugin that allows users to generate and explore Euclidean rhythms

## Issue(s)
- Audible pop/click sound every time a sound is outputted, which is more apparent for sine wave and triangle wave due to abrupt amplitude change.
- Animation desyncs whenever user interacts with the 'speed' knob and this issue is more likely to occur when the user moves the knob very fast.
